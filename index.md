# Noah Goodin's Portfolio

Hello everyone! I am Noah Goodin. I am currently a second year undergraduate at Cal State Fullerton, and in my first year as a computer science major. My favorite animal is a cat. I grew up with three cats, which was a period of time I look back on with a lot of love. I hope to have a cat later on in my 20s. My favorite video game is 'SSX Tricky', a snowboarding game on the Nintendo Gamecube. Even after having it for more than a decade and after the hundreds of hours I have put in, I can still come back to the game and play the first track without getting bored for a second. A game I also look fondly on from the past is 'The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker', which was a game my entire family would play at dinner. The thing I like most about computer science is learning new tools and discovering what I can do with them. As someone who is interested and has participated in game making, the funnest part is always figuring out how 'bland' components like an integer or a loop can be translated into making a piece of a game.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1, Part 1.
The first lab as the first favorite lab. What makes this lab so memorable is of how it looks now that I have completed the course. To think that I spent an hour and a half trying to wrap my head around one instruction, changing the 'Hello World' to 'Hello Noah' is very funny to think about. It just goes to show how much I've grown in the class. Even though it wasn't that difficult, it was the fact that it was new which made it look hard. This is a perspective I hope to keep in mind whenever I try something new, remembering to think about how eventually I will look at this challenge with laughter.

* Lab 7, Part 1.
For this lab we had to write code that would let the user know if the parking was valid. What I liked most about the lab was the part where we were using the '&&' and '||' tools in order to distinguish the different dates and times the people could park depending on the sign. It was a fun puzzle to think how we could split up these restrictions. As someone who likes creating games, I could see how these tools could work well for things like item shops, or unlocking levels. It also made me think how it is used in more everyday applications, like actual parking meters or arcade machines.

* Lab 2, Part 1.
For lab 2 we had to make a madlib, utilizing the 'std' namespace to store and display user input. This was the first real introduction to these tools, which were very fun to learn about since they opened the door to so many ideas for writing my own programs. This lab inspired me to make projects for my brother and mom to try out because now they could actually interact with my code!
